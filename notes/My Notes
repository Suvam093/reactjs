USESTATE is used to set the data or we can say to update the data on the ui 
It helps us to update the data at multiple places with ease

USEEFFECT is used to perform a action whenever a component is mounted in our case we can use 
useEffect whenever we are loading into a page to perform a task like fetching api's

USEID is used to generate unique id which can be used in mapping 
but we should not use the useId hook for 


USECONTEXT is used to create a global variable that can be used by any of the components
Its mostly used to manage the states
and it is used so that we can update the state from where we want to 
if we create a global file and export the data then the state will be updated from wjere we dont want it to and thats why we use useContext hook 

import 'React' from react
const userContext= useContext()
export default userContext

context ak variable provide hi toh kr rha ha, Toh harr ak context ak provider hi hota ha

ab context me ko use krne par uske andar jitne bhi components ha woh uss context ka access le sakte ha




ak usercontext file banana ha usme ak funtion call hoga jisme export default kr dena ha
phit ak usercontextprovider hoga jo provide krega

ab iss provider me ak children pass hoga function me jo return ho jata ha as it is bus ak value le lena hota ha user , set user kr ke jo hume update ke display krna hota ha (global variable se)
